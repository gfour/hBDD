A Haskell Binding to some BDD Libraries.		-*- Outline -*-
----------------------------------------

FIXME update

Linux: no GHCi support (Cabal's not doing the job)

OS X: CMUBDD has no GHCi support. Also need to hack the header as
__STDC__ apparently isn't working properly in c2hs.

* Prerequisites

hBDD has been developed and tested using GHC 6.2.2 and 6.4 on Debian
GNU/Linux and GHC 6.4 on Mac OS X 10.4. The more recent GHC 6.4 uses a new
package / library management system (Cabal) which required some substantial
changes to hBDD, and so may not be completely stable.

I haven't tried this under NHC or Hugs; it's probably not too far off
working, though. Well, apart from NHC having trouble with MPTCs, of
course...

You may also wish to compile and install the Long/CMU BDD package:

	http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~modelcheck/bdd.html

CUDD is included with hBDD:

	http://vlsi.colorado.edu/~fabio/

and is recommended.

See below for information on the different BDD packages (including CUDD!).

If you want to hack this library, it's convenient to have a copy of c2hs:

	http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~chak/haskell/c2hs/

and haddock:

	http://haskell.org/haddock/

To hack the build system, you'll need a recent autoconf (2.54 or later
should be fine; earlier versions probably not).

If you find you need these packages to simply build hBDD, this is a
bug. Please notify us and we will fix it.

* The CUDD BDD Package

CUDD lacks an install target and a configure script, and so needs to be
setup by hand for your particular system. Examine:

	<hbdd toplevel>/cudd-2.4.1/Makefile

and adjust the compiler flags for your system. The defaults work fine on
Debian GNU/Linux x86 for me.

You can use an alternative version or installation of the library:

   % ./configure --with-cudd=<src location> ...

hBDD will build CUDD as part of building the cudd directory. In other words,
after adjusting the Makefile you should be able to just "make" and "make
install".

* The CMU/Long BDD Package

To install it, just build and install the contents of the "mem" and "bdd"
subdirectories - hBDD does not require the other things.

* Mac OS X issues

** The CUDD BDD Package

You'll need to change the Makefile. In particular, OS X apparently doesn't
support the timing functions so you'll need to remove the "-DBSD" option.

** CMU/Long library

For some reason $HOSTTYPE is not set when installing this library. A
solution is to manually move the libraries to the place they would be on
other systems:

% mkdir ~/lib/powerpc/
% mv ~/lib/libbdd.a ~/lib/libmem.a ~/lib/powerpc/

(NOTE: adjust paths as appropriate).
