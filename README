A Haskell Binding to some BDD Libraries.			-*- Outline -*-
----------------------------------------

This library provides a convenient abstraction of several BDD packages
in Haskell. The intention is to furnish most useful Boolean operations
with a purely functional interface, while still allowing access to the
operational features (like variable re-ordering) via the IO monad.

I have abandoned BuDDy support and am focussing on CUDD. The CMU/Long
binding is of mostly historic interest.

* Installing

See the file `INSTALL'.

* Documentation

Haddock-generated documentation for the Haskell bindings can be found
in the 'doc' directory. CMU/Long's manpage - bdd(3) - is also a source
of valuable information. CUDD's implementation is quite readable.
