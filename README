A Haskell Binding to some BDD Libraries.			-*- Outline -*-
----------------------------------------

This library provides a convenient abstraction of several BDD packages
in Haskell. The intention is to furnish most useful Boolean operations
with a purely functional interface, while still allowing access to the
operational features (like variable re-ordering) via the IO monad.

I have abandoned BuDDy support and am focussing on CUDD. The CMU/Long
binding is of mostly historic interest and has only been lightly
tested in recent years.

* Installing

Install the CUDD and/or CMU/Long BDD packages.

runghc Setup configure --user -p --enable-library-profiling --ghc-option=-auto-all --ghc-option=-caf-all
runghc Setup build
runghc Setup install

You may need to use Cabal flags --extra-include-dirs and
--extra-lib-dirs to point it at the location of the BDD libraries.

* Documentation

Haddock-generated documentation for the Haskell bindings can be found
in the 'doc' directory. CMU/Long's manpage - bdd(3) - is also a source
of valuable information. Also the documentation for CUDD is very
readable (albeit obscure at times), and the implementation quite
clean.
