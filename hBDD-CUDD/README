CUDD lacks an install target and a configure script, and so needs to be
setup by hand for your particular system. Examine:

	<hbdd toplevel>/cudd-2.4.1/Makefile

and adjust the compiler flags for your system. The defaults work fine on
Debian GNU/Linux x86 for me. I use the one from Macports under OS X.
